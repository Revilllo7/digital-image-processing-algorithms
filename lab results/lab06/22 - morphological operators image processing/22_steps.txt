1. Rotate by -15 degrees
2. Make sure the image is 8 bits and binarise.
3. Take the most eroded looking "1" for your structural element.

It should look like this roughly:
0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0
0 * 1 0
0 * 1 0
0 * 1 0
0 * 1 0
0 * 1 0
0 * 1 0
0 * 1 0
0 * 1 0
0 * 1 0
0 * 1 0
0 * 1 0
0 0 0 0

Because we have an "encasing" of 0s, it won't catch "k's" or "l's" or edges, or lines from the grid.
It will not catch the (b) due to difference in length.

IT WILL however miss a singular "1" cause it got flipped horizontally and vertically during binarisation.
4. To add it, just change the structural element and erode with it.
5. Add both images in image calculator.
6. Dilate with a stample to get the "1's" back or count the number of black pixels to get the count.
